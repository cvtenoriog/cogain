The original COGAIN Work Package 3 (WP3) concentrated on User Involvement. The COGAIN project has ended but the COGAIN Association continues the work, as well as COGAIN partners in their own organizations.

###  Questionnaires on User Needs and the Physical Benefits of using an eye control system 

An essential part of this project is to actively involve people with disabilities and those who support them in order to bring about improvements with this exciting new technology. By responding to either of these questionnaires, you will be playing a significant part in ensuring that the aims of the project remain closely linked to what people with disabilities actually _need_, rather than what others might _think_ they need.
