EyeArt (illustrated in the figure on the right) is a drawing program that can be controlled by eye movements. EyeArt includes tools for drawing basic shapes (line, circle, square, etc.), tools for changing color and line width, on-screen keyboard, as well as an inbuilt help and options dialog that can all be controlled by gaze alone. 

**To install EyeArt**, download the zip-packet and uncompress the files into any folder. Start the program by selecting EyeArt.exe. 

**To use EyeArt**, you need an eye tracking device that supports mouse emulation. (EyeArt can also be used with headmouse or any other pointing device that supports mouse emulation.) First calibrate your eye tracker and start its mouse emulation program. Start the EyeArt program. Move the mouse cursor to point an item by looking at it. Select the item by staring at it for a while. The "dwell time" needed to stare at an item to select it can be adjusted in the options dialog. 

**To draw** e.g. a line, first select the line tool from the menu. Look the start point of the line and dwell on it to confirm the starting point. Then move your gaze to the end point and dwell on it to finish the line.
