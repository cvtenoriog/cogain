##  Information about Dasher 

Dasher is a information-efficient communication system driven by continuous pointing gestures. Instead of using a keyboard, the user writes by _continuous_ steering, zooming into a landscape painted with letters. Dasher can be driven by a regular mouse, by touch-screen, or by gaze-direction. Dasher uses a language model to reduce the number of gestures needed. Anything can be written, and well-predicted phrases can be written fastest. The language model can be trained on any documents, it learns as the user writes, and Dasher works in any of the languages of Europe. With practice, users can write at 25 words per minute via a gaze-tracker. 

Dasher supports writing, writing to files, writing to other windows, and speaking; the development version of Dasher includes other control options, such as accessing the menus of all applications running on the computer. 

Dasher is free software. It was created in the [Inference group][1] at the University of Cambridge.
