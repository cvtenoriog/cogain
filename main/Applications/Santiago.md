Gaze-controlled adventure game (FULL GAME!)

|:---:|


The Road to Santiago (illustrated in the figure above) is a graphic adventure game that can be played solely by eye movements. The player guides the game character along the game. This is a full game (not only a demo version as earlier)! 

**To install The Road to Santiago**, first download and uncompress the zip-packet. Depending on the version you download, run either Santiago_setup.exe or Santiago_light_setup.exe to install the game to your computer. 

**To operate The Road to Santiago**, you need an eye tracking device that supports mouse emulation (or a headmouse or any other pointing device that supports mouse emulation). See the manual of your eye tracker to find out how to activate its mouse emulation program. Move the mouse cursor to point an item by looking at it. Select the item by staring at it for a while. The waiting time ("dwell time") needed to stare at an item to select it can be adjusted in the options menu (accessible from the main menu). 

**To play The Road to Santiago**, select _Programs>The Road to Santiago>The Road to Santiago_ on the Start menu. Make sure that the Windows desktop resolution is 1024x768 (recommended) or higher. Select _Programs>The Road to Santiago>Configure settings_ to select change setting. 

Hint: If you get stuck, you may use the game's inbuilt hint system; you can call for help with the game character's cell phone. 

For detailed instructions on how to install, uninstall, operate and play the game, see the instructions
