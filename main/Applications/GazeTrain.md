GazeTrain (illustrated in the screenshot on the right) is an action oriented puzzle game, that can be controlled by eye movements. In GazeTrain you must guide a train by placing track tiles in front of it. As you guide the train, you must collect various cargo and drop them off at the nearest city thereby earning money. For further details regarding how to play the game, we encourage you to read the tutorial accessible from the main menu. The game is quite customizable as the dwell time and several other parameters can be adjusted to best suit your play-style. For further information regarding customization, consult the readme.txt found alongside the game.

##  User guide 

**To install GazeTrain**, download the zip-packet and uncompress the files into any folder. Start the program by executing the GazeTrain.exe. 

**To use GazeTrain**, you need an eye tracking device that supports mouse emulation. GazeTrain can also be used with headmouse or any other pointing device that supports mouse emulation (, such as a simple mouse). First calibrate your eye tracker and start its mouse emulation program. Then start GazeTrain. 

**How to play?** We suggest reading (at least) the simple tutorial in GazeTrain, before playing the actual game. It is also recommendable to practice using the practice mode to get a better understanding of the various game mechanics. 

For more information, read the included readme.txt file.

##  GazeTrain Source 

In an effort to encourage user participation, we have released the source code for GazeTrain, which you are free to modify and re-distribute under the [GNU General Public license][3]. Breifly, this means you are free to download, modify and distribute your own version of the game, as long as it is released under the same license. We also ask that you include a reference to the original source and creator, either in the game or the associated readme.txt file. GazeTrain has been created in [Game Maker 7.0 Pro][9] which you will need in order to properly modify the source and redistribute and executable.
