##  Information about UKO-II eye communication system 

NOTE: UKO-II is not supported at the moment, however, you are free to download it on your own risk. 

UKO-II is a communication system that adapts to the needs of the user by providing customizable keyboard layouts and varying number of buttons. UKO-II is based on an open architecture for a communication system, with publicly available sources of the programmable and extendable Emacs text editor, which already includes many text entry and manipulation functions. Furthermore, the operating system support (e.g. sockets), basic applications like mail, and a development environment with extensive documentation are at the programmer's fingertips. All components in the communication aid dealing with input/output have been implemented as Emacs Lisp modules. 

The system is customizable to differing keyboard layouts and to the selection of word suggestions or additional editing commands. 

UKO-II is designed by Karin Harbusch and Michael KÃ¼hn in the [University of Koblenz-Landau][3]. Unfortunately UKO-II is not supported at the moment. You can read more about how it functions in a paper found here: [PDF][4]

    small buttons

            (setq uko-emacs-directory "C:\ whatever path to \UKO-II\") ;;
