##  What it is

An application that uses eye gaze data to generate key and mouse events for playing games such as World of Warcraft and Second Life. 

See videos on YouTube: 

Snap Clutch offers a means of using eye gaze data to generate keyboard and mouse events, so that an underlying game or program responds as if they had come from the actual keyboard and mouse input devices. As the program that generates these events is independent from the game itself, we can, with certain limitations, drive any game that responds to keyboard and mouse events by gaze input. World of Warcraft and Second Life have been used so far as the main test applications. Documentation is very limited at this stage so please use the forums for help and also bug reporting.

##  Glancing off screen

The application works by making different sets of gaze interaction techniques available to the user and allowing them to switch rapidly between them. This occurs by performing a glance that starts anywhere onscreen and ends offscreen. The interaction mode you have entered depends upon what screen edge you have glanced over. 

**Windows Control (Optimised for control of the Windows interface)**

* Gaze only, free to look (glance off bottom screen edge) 
* Left mouse dwell click (glance off left screen edge) 
* Right mouse dwell click (glance off right screen edge) 
* Left mouse drag (glance off top screen edge) 

**MMORPG (Optimised for playing World of Warcraft)**

* Look around (glance off bottom screen edge) 
* Locomotion (glance off top screen edge) 
* Left mouse dwell click (glance off left screen edge) 
* Right mouse dwell click (glance off right screen edge) 

**MMORPG (Optimised for playing Second Life)**

* Look around (glance off bottom screen edge) 
* Locomotion (glance off top screen edge) 
* Left mouse dwell click (glance off left screen edge) 
* Right mouse dwell click (glance off right screen edge) 

##  Dwelling off screen

* Return back to Snap Clutch (dwelling off bottom screen edge) 
* Show T9 predictive text interface (dwelling off left, right or top screen edge)) 

After starting Snap Clutch you must manually move to the application that you want to control. We are in the process of testing an application launcher to assist with this but that is for a later release.
