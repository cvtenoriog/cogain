# Eye Control Hints and Tips


A multimedia training resource to make the initial assessment process and eye control take-up as successful as possible for as many people as possible. 

**Microsoft Power Point Show (*.pps)** \- If you do not have Microsoft PowerPoint installed to your computer (or if you have an old version of the PowerPoint), you may need a stand-alone [PowerPoint Viewer 2007][1] (or [2003 version][2]) to view the PPS files. 

To download the presentation, first click the link (if the download does not start, try clicking the link with the right mouse button and select "save as ..."). Please be patient, it may take some time for the multimedia files to download completely. Uncompress the files in the ZIP packet into one directory. 

To view the presentation, double click the .PPS file. Select "read only" if PowerPoint shows a dialog asking for either a password or read only mode. If you have any problems in running the presentation (e.g. you don't hear the sound when clicking the sound icon), please try opening the presentation (the .pps file) in the newest version of the [PowerPoint Viewer][1]. 

**Adobe PDF (*.pdf)** \- You need [Adobe PDF Reader][3] to view the PDF files.
